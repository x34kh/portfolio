### Vulnerability Management Visibility Optimization

**Problem:**  
External vulnerability scans provided limited visibility, as they only assessed network-exposed services. This left management without a complete picture of risks associated with non-network-facing components across the infrastructure.  

**Solution:**  
I built a custom vulnerability correlation system leveraging internal configuration data and public vulnerability databases:  

- **Data Collection:** Pulled package inventory data from the internal CMDB (gathered via OS package managers).  
- **Vulnerability Mapping:** Retrieved reported vulnerabilities from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for the past 3 years.  
- **Data Processing:** Normalized both datasets into Pandas DataFrames and performed SQL-like joins to match installed package versions against reported vulnerable versions.  

**Optimization:**  
The initial process (5GB data, >3,000 hosts, thousands of packages) took over 10 hours. By optimizing joins and reducing unnecessary rows, I cut execution time to **under 5 minutes** while maintaining accuracy.  

**Impact:**  
This solution gave management **clear visibility into under-patched components**, prioritized patching efforts, and reduced reliance on incomplete external scans. It directly improved infrastructure security posture and risk awareness.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python (Pandas, DataFrames)  
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)  
- Internal CMDB (package manager data)

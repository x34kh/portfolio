### "Zeus Electrics" Appointment Creation Bot

I designed and implemented a Telegram bot that streamlined customer service by automating complaint intake and appointment scheduling.  

- **Natural Language Input:**  
  The bot accepts customer complaints written in natural language.  

- **AI-Powered Categorization:**  
  Integrated with a locally hosted LLM (Ollama, Llama 3.2) to summarize and categorize requests into the correct service type.  

- **Information Collection:**  
  Guided users to provide required details such as account information, location, and issue description.  

- **Workflow Integration:**  
  Connected with **N8N** to create activities in **Oracle Field Service**, setting the appropriate activity type and location.  

- **Customer Feedback Loop:**  
  Once the appointment was scheduled, the bot returned details (date, technician assignment, etc.) back to the customer.  

**Impact:**  
This solution reduced manual intake effort, improved accuracy in activity classification, and gave customers a fast, user-friendly way to book services directly through chat.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Telegram Bot API  
- **AI/LLM:** Ollama (Llama 3.2)  
- **Workflow Orchestration:** N8N  
- **Field Service Integration:** Oracle Field Service Cloud
